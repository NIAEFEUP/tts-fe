## Infrastructure issues (foundation)

### Issue I-1 — Backend foundation and reference implementation
**Labels:** `backend`, `infra`, `T2`  
**Milestone:** Foundation  
**Estimate:** 4–6 days  
**Suggested owner:** Backend dev #1 + Backend dev #2  
**Blocked by:** —

#### Description
Before any endpoint work can begin, the backend needs a working skeleton and one complete reference feature. This issue sets the patterns that all other backend issues will follow.

Implement:
- Auth middleware: extract session cookie and expose `user` on Elysia context
- Consistent error format: `{ error: string, code: string }`
- Pagination and base response helpers
- Reference implementation for `GET /api/v1/faculties`, `GET /api/v1/faculties/:acronym`, `GET /api/v1/faculties/:acronym/courses`
- Integration test pattern using `createApp().handle(...)`
- Seeded dev data for at least `Faculty`, `Course`, `FacultyCourse`, `User`
- Backend issue template

#### Acceptance criteria
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/faculties` returns a list of faculties
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/faculties/:acronym` returns a single faculty
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/faculties/:acronym/courses` returns courses for a faculty
- [ ] Auth middleware exposes `user` on context for authenticated routes
- [ ] Errors return `{ error, code }`
- [ ] At least one integration test exists and passes
- [ ] Dev seed script runs successfully
- [ ] Backend issue template is created in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/backend.md`
